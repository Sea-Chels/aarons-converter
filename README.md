# aarons-converter

Hi! This is your friendly neighborhood millimeter converter. Let's get started on how to install and use me! 

Please download this github repository to your local machine using git and your command line application (either on windows or terminal on mac)

Once you've done that, please make sure you have Node.js installed as well. You can do this via Homebrew or Via the official website. 

When you've gotten Node.js installed, open go to the repository folder in your commandline and in the main folder, run the command: npm run electron:serve

This should pop up an app window automatically. 

Once the window is open, there will be a simple input bar, type in any decimal number or fraction and it will automatically convert that number from inches to millimeters, and pop up a button that will allow you to easy-copy the result. 

Boom! Done.

Use at your leisure.
